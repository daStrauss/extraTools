These scripts were perhaps some of my best script names. I had a wrapper function that set parameters called "rapperb". It called a function called "runDMC". So clearly, there had to be a script called, "myAdidas". I'll award stars if you choose something equally good.

So "myAdidas" is the script that create a ".pbs" file with the matlab executables. It then creates a qsub command and runs it, grabbing the system return value which is then fed to "waitforexit", which will monitor the queue until the job has completed. 

From there, you can build up more complicated things. All of the stuff I have is pretty specific to what I was doing, i.e. running through a bunch of monte carlo trials and changing certain parameters.
